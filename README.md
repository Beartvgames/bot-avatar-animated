# Change your bot avatar to an animated one
## Recently discord announced that now applications can have an animated avatar, but if you try the discord.com/developers website you will see that you can't, because to modify the avatar you must make a request to the discord api with the "PATCH" method and this repository will show you how to do it in node.js.
